# Okane Watch

Welcome to Okane watch. This is a tool to help families manage budget. It is self hosted through Docker and provides ways of adding family members, setting areas and budgets, and logging transactions.

## Setup

A simple docker compose is your best way to set this up. See example below. Remember to change the admin password when you start.

``` YAML
version: "3.9"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: PG_PASSWORD
      POSTGRES_USER: okane_watch
      POSTGRES_DB: okane_watch
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
    volumes:
      - ./pg-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
